Since part of the code involves the rest of our research group's work, unfortunately it is inconvenient to publish it as an open source project. The following are the pictures that appeared in the project, which is convenient for an intuitive understanding of the results.

01 The right picture is the reference model, the left one is cells in this model under the same condition. Compare to preliminaryly verify the correctness of this model.
